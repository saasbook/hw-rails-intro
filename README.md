Modifying RottenPotatoes
========================

# Rails Intro: add features to RottenPotatoes

In this homework you will add a feature to an existing simple Rails app
and deploy the result publicly on the Heroku cloud hosting service. We
will run live integration tests against your deployed version. 

General advice:  This homework involves modifying RottenPotatoes in
various ways. Git is your friend: commit frequently in case you
inadvertently break something that was working before! That way you can
always back up to an earlier revision, or just visually compare what
changed in each file since your last “good” commit. 

**Remember, commit early and often!**

# How to submit when you're all done

Deploying your finished app to Heroku by the homework deadline is part
of the grading process. Even if you have code checked in that works
properly, you still need to also deploy it to Heroku to get full
credit. 

Once you're confident the functionality works correctly on Heroku,
submit the 
URI of your deployed Heroku app in a text file with no other
contents. 

**Please be careful** to use **http** and not **https**, that is, 
submit `http://your-app.herokuapp.com` **and NOT**
`https://your-app.herokuapp.com`.
